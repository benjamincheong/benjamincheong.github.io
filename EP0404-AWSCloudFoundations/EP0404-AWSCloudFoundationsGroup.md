# Problem Statement

The _three-tier architecture_ with web and application tier server and a MySQL Database used by our start-up company should help workers streamline the process of registering specifically e-commerce goods into the database using a QR code that shows the relevant information of the worker and the product automatically into the database.

# Architecture Design

![AWSArchitecture Design](picturesGroup/AWSArchitectureDesign.jpg)

# Explanation of our solution

This architecture solution is a Multi-Availability zone deployment with an Amazon EC2 Web Instance in an _Auto Scaling Group_, _Amazon RDS, Amazon RDS__Read Replica, Elastic Load Balancer_.

Multi-Availability Zone allows the architecture to be fault-tolerant and high availability. It reduces downtime for required for version upgrades and reduces the impact of backup snapshots and creation of replicas.

The **Elastic Load Balancer** distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones which ensures _high availability_ and _fault tolerant_ applications and with _elasticity_ and _scalability_ and allows for dynamic and predictive scaling for EC2 Web Instances by using _AWS CloudWatch._ The EC2 instance can scale dynamically based on the demand for the given month, this will lower the cost of running the EC2 Web Instance. Therefore, it helps _optimize_ the cost of the architecture.

Amazon **Relational Database** provides _high availability_, _storage scalability_, _minimizes potential data loss_, _fault tolerant_. Amazon RDS provides synchronous replication for potential data loss. When the Amazon RDS fails, it will automatically bring the standby instance online as the new _main instance_. Amazon RDS protects your database instance if there is ever a _disruption within the availability zone_.

Therefore, this architecture is _high availability, high reliability_, _fault-tolerant_, _scalable_, _efficient_, and _resilient_ solution for the problem statement that we have defined.

## Compare and contrast alternative AWS solutions

  - Option A:

Option A architecture solution does offer the similar features in having Auto scaling group behind an ELB &amp; Amazon RDS instance deployed with read replicas in the other AZ. The difference in option A is that they have two AZs with three Amazon EC2 instances. They key difference it that having one lesser AZ would mean that they will have lesser availability. The consequence of that would be limiting the flow of traffic which can affect network congestion. They do have one more EC2 instance which allows them to have more control over the guest systems in the servers &amp; have more control of the traffic coming in and out of the instances. This improves the security level in both their application tier and web tier.

  - Option C:

For option C architecture solution, the key difference is that it runs a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS deployment as compared to option B&#39;s one Amazon RDS instance with read replicas in the other two AZ&#39;s. Multi-AZ Amazon RDS deployment has a Master database in one AZ and a Standby database in another AZ. It is a synchronous replica but cannot be accessed. Once the master database fails, the standby database will take over and starts to handle the traffic. This increases its reliability and reduce the downtime required for version upgrades and reduces the impact of backup snapshots and creation of replicas, since snapshots can be done from the spare (by the service). However, it doubles the cost of the instance because of it having a standby database.

## Strengths and Challenges of proposed solution

- Strengths
  - High Availability
  - High Fault-tolerance
  - High Resilient
  - Efficient
  - Cost Optimized
  - Dynamic Scalability
  - Resilient
  - Security Group for the Private Subnets

- Challenges

  - Slightly longer downtime due to RDS deployment with read replica
  - Unable to have massive read/write rates (150,000 write/second)
  - Greater Cost

# Issues Faced and Our Solution

  1. Auto Scaling &quot;Min/Max Instance&quot;

The issue we faced with the creation of the auto scaling group was with the section called &quot;Configure scaling policies&quot;.

We first configure the scaling policies by putting &quot;Scale between _2_ and _6_ instances&quot;. Along with adding the target value &quot;60&quot;.

![](picturesGroup/40.png)

However, after doing so we faced an error once we start creating the auto-scaling group:

![](picturesGroup/41.png)

So, for us to still have the right scaling policies applied. We first configured the scaling policy to &quot;Scale between _1_ and _2_ instances. &quot;

![](picturesGroup/42.png)

Which in return makes the creation of the auto scaling group succeeded. Here&#39;s the result:

![](picturesGroup/43.png)

After the creation of the auto scaling group, we navigate back and went to edit the auto scaling group that was created:

![](picturesGroup/44.png)

We then proceed to change the value of the _Min and Max Instances, where_ min value would be 2 and the max value would be 6 as what it was intended to be:

![](picturesGroup/45.png)

Once we click saved it successfully change the value and it was able to run the policy

![](picturesGroup/46.png)

1. Issued face was we can deploy a Multi-AZ Deployment for RDS, we wanted 1 master RDS and 2 other Read Replica so that we can scale our database based on the depends. This provides Scalability.
  1. Using AWS educate account, we are not authorized to perform a Multi-AZ Deployment

![](picturesGroup/47.png)

![](picturesGroup/48.png) ![](picturesGroup/49.png)

  1. What we did is to create a normal database without Multi-AZ Deployment, and we created read replicas as attached it to the different subnets with the same RDS Security Group
    1. Click Create Read Replica

![](picturesGroup/50.png)

    1. Configure the settings of the read replica as below

![](picturesGroup/51.png)

![](picturesGroup/52.png)

This will allow us to have a Maid RDS and 1 Read Replica in each Availability Zone
